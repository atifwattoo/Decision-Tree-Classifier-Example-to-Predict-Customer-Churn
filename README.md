# Decision Tree Classifier Example to Predict Customer Churn

## Overview
This project demonstrates how to predict customer churn (whether a customer leaves a service) using a Decision Tree Classifier. The dataset includes features like **age**, **monthly charges**, and **customer service calls**, with the goal of predicting whether a customer will churn or not.

The model is trained using Scikit-learn's Decision Tree Classifier, and the code visualizes the decision tree to better understand how the model is making decisions.

---

## Technologies Used
- **Python 3.x**: Primary language used for building the model.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and handling datasets.
- **Matplotlib**: For data visualization (plotting decision tree).
- **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning, including model training and evaluation.

---

## Steps Explained

### 1. **Import Necessary Libraries**
```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import warnings
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
from sklearn import tree
```

- **Pandas** (`pd`): 
  - This is used for data manipulation and loading data into DataFrame format. DataFrames allow you to organize and manipulate structured data like tables (rows and columns).

- **Matplotlib** (`plt`): 
  - This is a plotting library used to visualize data. Here, it’s used to plot the decision tree graphically, which helps in understanding how decisions are made at each node of the tree.

- **Warnings** (`warnings`):
  - The `warnings` module is used to suppress or handle warnings. In this code, we’re ignoring unnecessary warnings to keep the output clean and readable.

- **Scikit-learn** libraries:
  - **`train_test_split`**: This function splits the dataset into training and testing subsets. Training data is used to fit the model, and testing data is used to evaluate its performance.
  - **`DecisionTreeClassifier`**: This is the model that will be used to classify the data and predict customer churn. Decision Trees work by creating a tree-like model of decisions based on the features.
  - **`accuracy_score`**: This function calculates the accuracy of the model by comparing the predicted values with the actual values of the target variable (`Churn`).
  - **`tree`**: This module includes functions for visualizing the decision tree once it is trained.

### 2. **Suppressing Warnings**
```python
warnings.filterwarnings("ignore")
```
- This line tells Python to **ignore all warnings**. It can be helpful when you're running models and don't want warnings (such as those about deprecated functions) to clutter the output.

### 3. **Creating a Synthetic Dataset**
```python
data = {
    'CustomerID': range(1, 101),  # Unique ID for each customer
    'Age': [20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65]*10,  # Age of customers
    'MonthlyCharge': [50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 110, 120, 130, 140]*10,  # Monthly bill amount
    'CustomerServiceCalls': [1, 2, 3, 4, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 0]*10,  # Number of customer service calls
    'Churn': ['No', 'No', 'Yes', 'No', 'Yes', 'No', 'Yes', 'Yes', 'No', 'Yes']*10  # Churn status
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)
print(df.head())
```

- Here, we create a **synthetic dataset** for the project. This dataset simulates customer information for a telecom company, with features such as `Age`, `MonthlyCharge`, `CustomerServiceCalls`, and the target variable `Churn` (whether the customer churned or not).

  - **CustomerID**: Unique identifier for each customer.
  - **Age**: Customer’s age.
  - **MonthlyCharge**: Monthly bill of the customer.
  - **CustomerServiceCalls**: The number of times a customer called customer service.
  - **Churn**: Whether the customer churned (Yes/No).

- **Pandas DataFrame**: The data is structured as a DataFrame (`df`), a 2-dimensional labeled data structure, allowing easy manipulation and analysis of data.

### 4. **Splitting Data into Features and Target Variable**
```python
X = df[['Age', 'MonthlyCharge', 'CustomerServiceCalls']]  # Features
y = df['Churn']  # Target Variable
```
- **Features (`X`)**: The independent variables that are used to predict the target. In this case, it includes `Age`, `MonthlyCharge`, and `CustomerServiceCalls`.
- **Target variable (`y`)**: The dependent variable, which is the value you are trying to predict. Here, it is the `Churn` column, which indicates whether a customer will churn or not.

### 5. **Splitting the Data into Training and Testing Sets**
```python
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)
```
- **`train_test_split`** splits the dataset into two parts: a **training set** (used to train the model) and a **testing set** (used to evaluate the model).
  - **`test_size=0.3`**: 30% of the data is set aside for testing, and the remaining 70% is used for training.
  - **`random_state=42`** ensures reproducibility of results by fixing the seed for the random number generator.

### 6. **Training the Decision Tree Model**
```python
clf = DecisionTreeClassifier()
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)
```
- **`DecisionTreeClassifier()`** initializes the decision tree model.
- **`clf.fit(X_train, y_train)`** trains the model using the training data. The model learns patterns from the `X_train` features to predict the `y_train` target variable.

### 7. **Making Predictions**
```python
y_pred = clf.predict(X_test)
```
- **`clf.predict(X_test)`**: After the model is trained, it is used to make predictions on the test set (`X_test`). These predicted values are stored in `y_pred`, and we will compare them with the actual values (`y_test`) to evaluate the model.

### 8. **Evaluating the Model**
```python
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy}")
```
- **`accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)`** calculates the accuracy of the model by comparing the predicted churn labels (`y_pred`) with the actual churn labels (`y_test`) from the test set.
- The **accuracy** is a measure of how many predictions were correct. It is printed out for evaluation.

### 9. **Visualizing the Decision Tree**
```python
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 8))
tree.plot_tree(clf, filled=True, feature_names=['Age', 'MonthlyCharge', 'CustomerServiceCalls'], class_names=['no churn', 'churn'])
plt.show()
```
- **`tree.plot_tree(clf, filled=True)`**: Visualizes the trained decision tree model. The `filled=True` argument colors the nodes based on the class label (Churn/No Churn).
- **`feature_names`**: Specifies the names of the features (independent variables) to display in the tree.
- **`class_names`**: Specifies the class labels for the target variable (`Churn`).
- **`plt.show()`**: Displays the tree visualization.
